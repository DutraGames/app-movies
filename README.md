# App Movies

## üì∞**Description**:

A simple app created with expo, referring to the interior 4 of channel [Sujeito Programador](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLc5Bq2yfs-S3Zse3ZFRMEQ).
Where I developed in a way that suits my taste and need.

Hope this little code can help people learn how to use expo and TypeScript. :D
